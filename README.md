# YouTube Video Downloader

This is a simple website where you can download YouTube videos in MP4 or MP3 format. 

## Features:
- Paste YouTube URL to fetch video info
- Select MP4/MP3 format
- Choose quality (only for MP4)
- Progress bar to show download progress

## How to Host:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Upload to GitHub Pages.
3. Replace `api.example.com` with your backend server endpoint for fetching video info and handling downloads.

### Note:
- The backend logic (video downloading and progress tracking) cannot be handled directly by GitHub Pages, so you must set up a separate server for that functionality.
